# Book-a-Book
Book Reselling app


## About the project:

Our team decided to design a book exchange/reselling app for fellow bibliophiles to
help easy exchange of books and bond over our love for authors and literature. We
included features like a chat screen for direct and seamless conversation between
buyers and sellers and firebase google sign-in for authentication. Sellers can upload
images of their book from their gallery and other relevant details such as the title,
price and a brief description of the book on the ads sell page. Meanwhile users are
greeted with an animated splash screen on opening the app, after which they can see
a list of the trending products on the home page and contact the sellers to discuss the
deal. Our target demographic was avid book readers who were interested in buying
books for cheaper prices, students who could sell their books after passing a specific
grade and students of lower grades who could contact them for these course books.
We had a lot of fun coming up with the design of the app and learned quite a lot
along the way!

## What we learnt

We all learned a great deal about flutter through the ‘Flutter tutorials for Beginners’
playlist by The Net Ninja. We also watched the Figma playlist for UI/UX design by
Selfstudy Space on Youtube and both of these were amazing in their explanation and
detail. Most of us did not have much experience with github or pushing and pulling
repositories and we learned that over the course of this project from our teammate.
We also tried to incorporate firebase, imagepicker dependency and lottie animations
by watching tutorials available on youtube. We had daily targets and late night meets
to come up with creative designs and clever features to integrate. Overall, we had a
great time learning flutter and helping each other on the way, resolving errors among
ourselves and with mentors and working on the project was a really cool experience
for all of us. Special thanks to Arvind Bhaiya, Rishabh Bhaiya, Ritvij Bhaiya and
Umang Bhaiya for their mentorship and support during this project!
